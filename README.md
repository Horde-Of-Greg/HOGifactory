## Features:
### Unique to this fork
- [ZBGT](https://github.com/Zorbatron/ZBGT) Integration
- No more normal/hard mode differences. This is based on hard mode but takes features from normal mode, like keeping nomicoins.
- Content up to MAX
- More complex processing lines
- Tweaks to add some QoL we think are good additions to the pack.

### Features from base Nomi-CEu Hard mode
- Forced peaceful mode

## Contributing and Maintainer Information

## Addon Mods
We have kept the addon mods of base Nomi-CEu but may just add some of them (like AE2FCr) as a base mod.

- [AE2 Fluid Crafting Rework](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-fluid-crafting-rework)
- [Compact Machines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compact-machines)
- [Flux Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flux-networks)
- [Lazy AE2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazy-ae2)
- [Project Red - Illumination](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-red-illumination)

\* Note: If you are adding these mods via the CurseForge app, remove the extra copy of AE2 **(*non*-extended life)**, of which it might automatically download.

## Features:

### Unique to this fork

- [ZBGT](https://github.com/Zorbatron/ZBGT) Integration
- No more normal/hard mode differences. This is based on hard mode but takes features from normal mode, like keeping nomicoins.
- Content up to MAX
- More complex processing lines
- Tweaks to add some QoL we think are good additions to the pack.

### Features from base Nomi-CEu Hard mode

- Forced peaceful mode

## Addon Mods

We aim to keep the addon mods philosophy of base Nomi-CEu by keeping addon mods alive, and maybe even expand on the quantity of those.

We have not added any yet, but we sure will.
